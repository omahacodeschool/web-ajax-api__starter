# Weather Application

Your goal with this assignment is to use AJAX to update a webpage with information from a "database". (The "database" in this case is just some hard-coded JSON information in the **/api** file.)

You are provided with a static view that shows what information you'll need to display from the API. You must run this site from a server for AJAX to work properly. Once you're doing that, visit the `index.html` page to see what you're working with.

The page you'll see has placeholder content in it. Your task is to access **/api** with AJAX to replace the placeholder content with real data.

So the page will load, there might be a moment's wait while **/api** is accessed... And then right before the user's eyes, the content on the page will change to real values, as the response from **/api** is received.

Alter the HTML as needed to make it easier for you to select elements in the DOM.

## Learning Outcomes

- Practice using AJAX to receive complex JSON responses
- Practice updating the DOM based on information from an a JSON response
- Deepen knowledge of JavaScript data structures like arrays and key-value pairs (a.k.a. "objects")
